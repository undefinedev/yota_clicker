# yota_clicker
Bash script for automatic resume Yota internet on "low speed"

Thanks for original idea from https://github.com/andrychuyko/yota_check

This script successfully run on OpenWrt router.  
In comparison of above script it doesn't require huge python, just only curl tool

opkg update
opkg install curl
```
